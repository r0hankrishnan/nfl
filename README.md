# NFL Playoff Prediction Project (In Progress)
**If you are visiting from my CV, please go to the `class-work` folder to see my code and writing submissions**

*Apologies for the incomplete README, I am in the process of updating and expanding upon my submitted work for this project!*

Using self-gathered data, I will explore various methods of predicting what NFL teams will make the playoffs using python. This project was originally done in Spyder but is being recreated and expanded upon using VSCode for learning purposes.

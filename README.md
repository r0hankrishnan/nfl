# nfl-playoff-predictor (In progress)
**If you are visiting from my CV, please go to the `class-work` folder to see my code and writing submissions**

*Apologies for the incomplete README, I am in the process of updating and expanding upon my submitted work for this project!*

This is an expansion on homework 2 of the capstone class for ECON 1700: Big Data Economics. Using self-gathered data, I will explore various methods of predicting what NFL teams will make the playoffs using python. This project was originally done in Spyder but is being recreated and expanded upon using Jupyter Notebooks for learning purposes.
